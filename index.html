    <h1>Privacy Policy for TempContacts</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using TempContacts ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Our core principle is privacy: your data is your own, and our app is designed to keep it that way.</p>

    <h2>Information We Access</h2>
    <p>To provide its full functionality, TempContacts requires access to certain information and permissions on your device. All of this information is processed <strong>locally on your device only</strong> and is <strong>never uploaded, collected, or shared with us or any third party.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The permissions we request and why we need them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera (`CAMERA`)</strong>: Required for the business card scanner feature. Images are processed on your device in real-time and are not stored or transmitted.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Contacts (`READ_CONTACTS`, `WRITE_CONTACTS`)</strong>: Required to read your address book to display contact names, and to save, edit, or delete contacts as you direct.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Log (`READ_CALL_LOG`, `WRITE_CALL_LOG`)</strong>: Required to display your call history in the "Call Logs" tab and to delete entries as you direct.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone (`CALL_PHONE`, `READ_PHONE_STATE`, `READ_PHONE_NUMBERS`)</strong>: These are required to initiate phone calls, handle dual-SIM selection, and to power the optional "Callback Reminder" feature by detecting when a call has ended.</li>
        <li><strong>Accounts (`GET_ACCOUNTS`)</strong>: Required to show you a list of available accounts (e.g., Google, SIM) where you can choose to save a permanent contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications & Services (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)</strong>: Required for the optional "Callback Reminder" feature to run in the background and show you notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibration (`VIBRATE`)</strong>: Required to provide haptic feedback on the dialer keypad and for swipe gestures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data accessed by TempContacts, including your contacts, call logs, and any temporary contact or reminder information you create, is stored in a secure, private database <strong>on your device only</strong>. This information is not accessible to other apps and is deleted if you uninstall TempContacts.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
